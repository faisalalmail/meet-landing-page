## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have to say that when I compare this challenge to the previous challenges I completed, I consider them child play!

This one was really tough to figure out, not only from responsive design prespective, but also workflow prespective.

I have done alot of work to come later and realise small details that I didnt notice the first time, yes its one landing page but there was many little details in the design that had to be tweaked.

The biggest learning outcomes:

1- using divs to display based on screen size `display:none;`.
2- Having image be out of the div border `margin-block-start:value`
3- understanding the proper way to use `background-blend-mode:value`



### Continued development

I look forward for fiddling with some Javascript
